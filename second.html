        Hey!!
        My Love
      </p>

      <p>I want to tell you something.Before you came into my life, I have faced a lot.</p>

      <p>
         From a young age, I have seen and experienced many things, as you know. But after you came into my life, happiness started to come back, and I began to heal. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, even today, I may be a little foolish, but I am learning to grow with your love. You understand me in such a way, you love me, you keep me happy. I cannot express how special you are to me in my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought of losing you makes my soul tremble. I am so scared. If I lose you, how will I live? I have lost so much already that I don't have the courage to lose anything more. I always want to be with you, I want to love you so much. I always pray for you to be happy, to be successful, to be healthy and strong. My love, I always want to see you happy and always want to be with you. I want to fulfill all my dreams with you, and I want to be your companion in your dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I know you don't like traveling, but I promise I will take care of your comfort. I will always ensure you are happy and never let you suffer.
      </p>

      <p class="center">I Love You Bugga💖</p>

      <p>
        Darling, if I ever make a mistake, please forgive me, considering me naive. Please don't ever leave your life. I truly, truly love you so much...
      </p>

      <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>

      <p class="center">Just tell me how you are feeling now&hellip;</p>

      <p>My love💖</p>

      <p class="center">Touch Here👇</p>
